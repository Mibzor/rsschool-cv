### Briefly About Myself:

I am a lover of new things and do different, but computer-related things. At first. I am studying the basics of circuit engineering in college. I'm learning how to design devices and assemble them. At a more applied level, I studied such areas as:
GameDev
3D Modeling in Blender
FrontEnd
BackEnd
At the moment, my goal is to study web development in depth. I want to understand qualitatively and deeply how web applications are built. To study both the technology of building websites and its promotion, the importance for a person, business. For me, building websites is not just writing code and exchanging time for money. Websites are an opportunity to influence people, an opportunity to make their lives effective and fun.
