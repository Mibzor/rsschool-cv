### Briefly About Myself:

I am a lover of new things and do different, but computer-related things. At first. I am studying the basics of circuit engineering in college. I'm learning how to design devices and assemble them. At a more applied level, I studied such areas as:
GameDev
3D Modeling in Blender
FrontEnd
BackEnd
At the moment, my goal is to study web development in depth. I want to understand qualitatively and deeply how web applications are built. To study both the technology of building websites and its promotion, the importance for a person, business. For me, building websites is not just writing code and exchanging time for money. Websites are an opportunity to influence people, an opportunity to make their lives effective and fun.

        count = input('Name?')
        rash = image[-3:]
        os.rename(folder + '\\' + image, folder + '\\' + str(count) + '.' + rash)
elif sys.argv[1] == '-123':
    count = 1
    for image in os.listdir(path=folder):
        rash = image[-3:]
        os.rename(folder + '\\' + image, folder + '\\' + str(count) + '.' + rash)
        count += 1
